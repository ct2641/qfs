1. Remove redundant encoding and decoding functions
2. Change the Jerasure interface to include GF-complete pass-through: avoid multithread safety issue.

The main changes to QFS:
1. CMakefile
2. instead of calling QFS native erasure encoding and decoding function, we let it call Jerasure functions
3. Change various parameter checking functions in QFS such that it can accept the general coding parameters.
